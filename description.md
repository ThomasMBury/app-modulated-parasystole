### Information:
This is an interactive visualisation for a simple model of modulated parasystole. The model used is
that proposed by
[Courtemanche et al.](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpheart.1989.257.2.H693).

###### Key:
* **PRC**: phase response curve
* **ts**: period of the sinus pacemaker
* **te**: period of the ectopic pacemaker
* **theta**: refractory period of the heart
* **T**: modulated period of ectopic pacemaker due to intervening sinus beat
* **phi**: phase of a sinus beat within the ectopic period
* **NN**: interval corresponding to two consecutive sinus beats
* **NV**: interval corresponding to a sinus beat immediately followed by an ectopic beat
* **VN**: interval corresponding to an ectopic beat immediately followed by a sinus beat
* **VV**: interval corresponding to two consecutive ectopic beats
* **NIB**: number of intervening sinus beats between two ectopic beats

###### Panels
* **Top-left**: control panel where parameter values for the simulation can be modified
* **Top-right**: selected phase response curve in bold, with the other PRCs also plotted
* **Middle-center**: interval length between two consecutive beats over time. The colour of the points indicates the type of beat that occurs at either end of the interval, as shown in the legend.
* **Bottom-left**: histogram showing the relative occurence of NIB values
* **Bottom-center**: histogram showing the distribution of NV and VN interval lengths
* **Bottom-right**: histogram for the inter-ectopic time interval

The graphs allow for zooming and scrolling with the mouse.
